#p_helloWorld

First Github upload! So proud of myself. I am currently on a gap year just to learn and refine my skills in web development and web design.
As of now 8/10/23, I havent touched javascript yet and I will first refine my skills of html and css and then create a second project and after that I will learn about javascript!
And thats all for my intro! Walk with me on my journey on becoming a full stack developer!

UPDATE!
First upload : 8/10/23 5 PM.
