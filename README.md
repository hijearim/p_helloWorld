First Github upload! So proud of myself. I am currently in a gap year just to learn and refine my skills in web development and web design.
As of now 8/10/23, I haven't touched javascript yet and I will first refine my skills in HTML and CSS and then create a second project after that I will learn about javascript!
And that's all for my intro! Walk with me on my journey to becoming a full-stack developer!

UPDATE!
First upload: 8/10/23 5 PM.
Overhaul completely to new design and everything. 9/10/23 8PM.
